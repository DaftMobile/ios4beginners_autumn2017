# iOS 4 Beginners class – MiMUW 2017


## Classes

### Class 1: Hello Swift

We were talking about the basics of Swift programming language:

- Variables and **constants** (`var` and `let` keywords)
- `String`
- `Array` and `Dictionary` data types (value types)
- Optionals (`Int?`, `String?`, `if let ...` syntax, and so on)
- Control Flow (`if`, `for` and `while` loops, `switch` statement (💪))
- Functions – defining a function with parameters in Swift (`func` keyword), return value type, calling functions, etc.
- Classes – defining a basic class, defining methods, class properties, initializers. We've also discussed inheritance in Swift, overriding methods and initializers.

To learn more, go through the [Swift Basics](./Class%201) playground.

### Class 2: Intermediate Swift and Introduction to AutoLayout

We were talking about some more advanced concepts of Swift, including:

- Enums!
- Structs
- Value Types vs Reference Types
- Nested Types
- Memory management in Swift

To learn more, go through the [Swift Intermediate](./Class%202) playground.

We've also started to talk about AutoLayout and basic usage of Interfac Builder in XCode.
